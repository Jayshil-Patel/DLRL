Let's discuss the observations based on the comparison of mean square errors before and after incorporating L2 regularization.

Observations and Comparisons:

Effect of Regularization (L2):

With L2 regularization, we observe a clear reduction in both Ein and Eout across different degrees of the polynomial.
Regularization helps in preventing overfitting, leading to a more generalized model.
Ein and Eout Convergence:

Ein and Eout tend to converge more closely when regularization is applied. This indicates that the model is less prone to overfitting.
Impact of Regularization Strength (λ):

Adjusting the regularization parameter (λ) allows us to control the trade-off between fitting the training data and maintaining a simpler model. Higher λ leads to a simpler model (smoother curves) but may underfit.
Sensitivity to Noise (σ):

The impact of regularization is more pronounced for higher noise levels (σ=0.2). This is expected as higher noise increases the risk of overfitting, making regularization more beneficial.
Degree of the Polynomial (d):

As the degree of the polynomial increases, Ein tends to decrease (overfitting increases), while Eout may increase (poor generalization).
Regularization helps in controlling this trend, keeping both Ein and Eout in check.
Optimal Model Complexity:

The optimal degree of the polynomial seems to vary with the level of noise and the amount of data (N). Regularization helps in stabilizing the choice of the optimal model complexity.
In summary, incorporating L2 regularization has a positive effect on the model's generalization and stability, especially in the presence of noise and for complex models. It helps strike a balance between fitting the training data and maintaining simplicity, leading to more robust models. The choice of the regularization parameter (λ) is crucial in achieving the right trade-off between fitting and generalization.

Observations

The following are some observations from the six plots:

Impact of model complexity (d): As the model complexity increases, the Ein decreases, but the Eout increases. This is because a more complex model is able to fit the training data better, but it is also more likely to overfit the training data and generalize poorly to new data.
Impact of sample size (N): As the sample size increases, both the Ein and Eout decrease. This is because a larger sample size provides more information about the underlying distribution of the data, which helps the model to learn the

For both lower (σ=0.05) and higher (σ=0.2) noise levels, we can observe how the errors change with the increase in dataset size and polynomial degree. Lower noise levels generally lead to lower errors. As the dataset size increases, the errors tend to decrease, indicating better generalization with a larger dataset.

In the case of higher noise (σ=0.2), the errors are generally higher compared to the lower noise case (σ=0.05). This is expected as noise makes it harder for the model to fit the data accurately.

Comparing the different optimization methods (GD, SGD, Mini-batch GD), we can observe variations in the errors. For specific dataset sizes and degrees, one method might perform better than the others. However, these differences may vary based on noise levels and dataset sizes.

Including weight decay regularization (not shown in the provided code) would affect the model's performance. It can help mitigate overfitting by penalizing large weights, thus promoting a simpler model. This would likely reduce the discrepancies between Ein and Eout.

Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights into the impact of noise, dataset size, model complexity, and optimization methods on the model's fitting and generalization capabilities. Further analysis with weight decay regularization would provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's behavior.
