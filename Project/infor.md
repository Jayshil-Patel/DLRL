   - The "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis" is a concept in the field of deep learning and neural networks. It suggests that within a large and over-parameterized neural network, there exists a small subnetwork, referred to as a "lottery ticket," that can perform equally well as the original large network. These lottery tickets are characterized by a specific set of network weights and connections.

   - The hypothesis implies that during the training of a neural network, a subset of the weights becomes crucial for the network's performance, while others are redundant. Identifying these critical subnetworks has practical implications, as they can lead to more efficient neural network architectures with a reduced number of parameters.

   - Your research will aim to clarify and validate this hypothesis in the context of deep learning. You will explore whether, in practice, it is possible to identify these lottery tickets and determine how they contribute to network performance. This exploration will involve conducting experiments, collecting data, and analyzing the characteristics of the discovered lottery tickets.

   - To summarize, the topic clarification for your mini-research project on the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis is to investigate the existence of lottery tickets in neural networks, understand their properties, and assess their impact on network performance. This research will contribute to the ongoing exploration of network pruning and efficiency in deep learning.

Remember that this clarification is essential for setting the stage for your research and ensuring that you and your team have a clear understanding of the topic's scope and objectives.

**2. Research Question:**
   - Based on your clarification of the topic, your research question could be something like: "To what extent does the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis hold true in the context of different neural network architectures and datasets?" This question will guide your investigation into the existence and properties of lottery tickets within various neural networks.

**5. Proposal Preparation:**
   - In your proposal, you should include the following elements:
     - A comprehensive survey of the background literature on the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, including key papers, findings, and related research.
     - A well-defined research problem: Explain the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis and why it's significant. Discuss any limitations or unanswered questions in existing research.
     - Proposed research plan: Outline your approach for investigating the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. Consider what types of neural networks you'll work with, which datasets you'll use, and which pruning methods you'll apply.
     - Feasibility and risk assessment: Discuss the feasibility of your research plan and any potential challenges or risks you may encounter. Consider the resources, data, and computational power required.
     - Organize your proposal presentation materials, which may include slides summarizing the above points.
